Building and running the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:

1.Using a C++ IDE, such as Eclipse, create a new project

2.Import the .h and .cpp files to the sources folder

3.Then use the IDE to build the program

4.To run the program with the default (random) mode, just run the main.cpp file

5.To run the program in the Machine Learning mode, apply a "-m" to the arguments panel when choosing the run configuration

5a.Alternativly to Step 4, applying the argument "-r" in the run configurations will also run the program in random mode.
